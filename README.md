- `Applications`: Contains the source codes of the subject systems.

- `Tutorials`: Contains the presentations used for expert analysis (RQ3).

Note1: If you want to test the subject systems with Auto-SCST, make each system as a java project in eclipse IDE.

Note2: We have evaluated Auto-SCST on the following source folders:

jocular/src/

jfreechart/source/

rackj-code/tags/trunk/

geom-java/src/main/

unicode/src/

avrora/src/

fop/src/

sunflow/src/

All the applications are open-source and can be freely accessed on github or sourceforge.

The source code of each of these tools has been included in this repository for the ease of access.
